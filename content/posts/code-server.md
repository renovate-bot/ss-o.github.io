### Setup code-server for remote access

![screenshot](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/master/doc/assets/screenshot.png)



> This entails downloading the latest version and creating a systemd service that will keep code-server always running in the background. 

- Github [code-server](https://github.com/ss-o/code-server)
  

```
$ mkdir ~/code-server && cd ~/code-server
```

> From official [github releases](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases) page of code-server pick the latest Linux build (the file will contain ‘linux’ in its name).


```
$ wget https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/3.2.0/code-server-3.2.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf code-server-3.2.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

> Copy it to /usr/lib/code-server so you’ll be able to access it system wide by running the following command:


```
$ sudo cp -r code-server-3.2.0-linux-x86_64 /usr/lib/code-server
```

> Then, create a symbolic link at /usr/bin/code-server, pointing to the code-server executable:


```
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/code-server/code-server /usr/bin/code-server
```

> Next, create a folder for code-server, where it will store user data:


```
$ sudo mkdir /var/lib/code-server
```

> Create `code-server.service` to run in background with the following commands:

```
$ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/code-server.service
```

> Add the following lines:

```
[Unit]
Description=code-server
After=nginx.service

[Service]
User=your_user
Type=simple
Environment=PASSWORD=your_password
ExecStart=/usr/bin/code-server --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:8080 --user-data-dir /var/lib/code-server --auth password
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Start the code-server service by running the following command:

```
$ sudo systemctl start code-server
```

> Check that it’s started correctly by observing its status:

```
$ sudo systemctl status code-server
```

> To make code-server start automatically after a server reboot, enable its service by running the following command:

```
$ sudo systemctl enable code-server
```

> Make sure nginx installed. As you have learned in the Nginx prerequisite step, its site configuration files are stored under /etc/nginx/sites-available and must later be symlinked to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled to become active.

> You’ll store the configuration for exposing code-server at your domain in a file named code-server.conf, under /etc/nginx/sites-available. Start off by creating it using your editor:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/code-server.conf
```
> Add following:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name code-server.your-domain;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
    }
}
```

> To make this site configuration active, you will need to create a symlink of it in the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled folder by running:

```
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/code-server.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/code-server.conf
```

> To test the validity of the configuration, run the following command:

```
$ sudo nginx -t
```

> For the configuration to take effect, you’ll need to restart Nginx:

```
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

> Setup certificate with cerbot:

```
$ sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx
$ sudo ufw allow https
$ sudo ufw reload
```

> And finally: 

```
$ sudo certbot --nginx -d code-server.your-domain
```
